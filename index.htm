				<div class="intro">
					My name is <span>Ntonde Edgar Isingoma</span>, a software engineer with three years'
					experience building projects. <br>
					I am experienced with both frontend and backend programming frameworks, although I don't fancy growing into
					the "full stack senior dev" title (I'd prefer backend on any day, but ultimately my contracts will decide
					where I fall).<br>
					I have gained proficiency in Javascript and its many 'dialects' (React, NextJS, ExpressJS, ElectronJS,
					Strapi), Flutter, Python, Django, MySQL (my beloved SQL), and behold, in the next section are some of my most
					presentable works of art.. er, I mean, code.
				</div>
				<div class="yokl">
					Yoklinic is a Ugandan telemedicine marketplace in its final stages of completion. It is an online hub that
					links doctors and medical facilities to everyday people through providing a platform for online appointments
					with features tailored to a medical setting, plus booking physical appointments. <br>
					I have worked with the Mobiklinic Uganda developer team to bring it to life and we used NextJS and Strapi
					here. I have done both front-end and back-end code on this one and it was a good opportunity for my first-time
					exposure to Strapi.<br>
					<a href="https://www.yoklinic.com">You can check it out here</a>

				</div>
				<div class="marketdoc">
					MarketDoctors was my first venture into real-world mobile application building, and I, together with a few
					colleagues, got the job done in Flutter with Strapi serving in the backend (pun intended). <br>
					MarketDoctors is a Nigerian-based mobile application that seeks to connect medical doctors to everyday people
					through Community Health Workers (CHWs) and the application interface.<br>
					The application is also under its final stages of development and it can be 
					<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.market_doctor&pcampaignid=web_share">downloaded from the Google PlayStore.</a>

				</div>
				<div class="sleekrep">
					Sleekreports is a small one-page website that makes report cards for a particular client school from
					data provided via a Ms Excel spreadsheet. It was built with HTML, CSS & Javascript and relies on a
					backend which was built with ExpressJS. <br>
					<a href="https://github.com/Ed-Isingoma/sleekreports-web">Here is the link to the site's code</a>, and below
					is a sample of what the finished report looks like.
					<img src="sleekrep sample.png">
				</div>
				<div class="merchhub">
					MerchantHub was a class project e-commerce website that I contributed to by writing its backend code
					with Django. And this is what the site looks like on frontend.The associated backend code I'm
					talking about is <a href="https://gitlab.com/thebaddest/merchanthub">here on gitlab</a>.
					<img src="merchhub sample.png">
				</div>
				<div class="prm">
					Now there's this, which was my first (almost) complete app called Personal Records Manager- PRM.
					<br>
					Oh, the joy that came with finally having an app to my name! So behold, a 60-MB app that only
					receives text information in the format of a Police officer's diary and stores them. I didn't do any
					compressing or "tree-shaking" whatsoever to minimise its file size, and then I soon left the project
					unperfected (though good enough) to move onto different work.
					<img src="prm sample.png">
					<br>
					This app was built with ElectronJS and also MySQL in an updated version for data storage. If you
					want to download the whole thing to see, <a href="https://github.com/Ed-Isingoma/prm/releases/tag/1.0.1">knock
						yourself out</a>.
				</div>
				<div class="outro">
					I'm still learning and I'm eager to. I've explored NestJS with Prisma, Java, AngularJS, C, but I dont want my knowledge scope to be "one mile wide and one inch deep", so I'm trying to be a master at whoever of all these languages wins my heart and the rest will find their level.<br>
					I do extra work not related to these projects though (C is interesting!) and never know-- a slight refreshing of this page might pop a new item onto the projects list üòÖÔ∏è. Just be on the lookout.<br>
					Thank you for your attention. And as you saw, the big links are at the top of the screen. Hoping to
					hear from you.
				</div>
				<div class="mescl">
					I built a website for <b>Mayuge Energy Solar Cooking Limited (MESCL)</b> to showcase their solar energy
					products and display important information about the organisation. <br>
					The website is not yet complete but is in advanced stages of building, as can be seen from <a
						href="https://mayugesolar.vercel.app">here</a>.
