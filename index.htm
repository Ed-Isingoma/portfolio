                    My name is <span>Ntonde Edgar Isingoma</span>, a software developer with about three years'
                    experience building projects. <br>
                    I am a backend developer üòéÔ∏è because my sentimental inclinations say so. Also because my most recent
                    programming certification is Database Engineering offered by Meta, but I have also written in
                    Javascript (of course), React, ExpressJS, ElectronJS, Python, Django, MySQL (which inspires my
                    identity), and behold! In the menu section are some of my most presentable works of code (...I mean,
                    my github has a
                    number of forked repos that I didnt even touch after forking).
                </div>
                <div class="sleekrep">
                    Sleekreports is a small one-page website that makes report cards for a particular client school from
                    data provided via a Ms Excel spreadsheet. It was built with HTML, CSS & Javascript and relies on a
                    backend which was built with ExpressJS. <br>
                    <a href="https://github.com/Ed-Isingoma/sleekreports-web">Here is the link to the site's code</a>, and below is a sample of what the finished report looks like.

                </div>
                <div class="merchhub">
                    MerchantHub was a class project e-commerce website that I contributed to by writing its backend code
                    with Django. And this is what the site looks like on frontend.The associated backend code I'm
                    talking about is <a href="https://gitlab.com/thebaddest/merchanthub">here on gitlab</a>.

                </div>
                <div class="prm">
                    Now there's this, which was my first (almost) complete app called Personal Records Manager- PRM.
                    <br>
                    Oh, the joy that came with finally having an app to my name! So behold, a 60-MB app that only
                    receives text information in the format of a Police officer's diary and stores them. I didn't do any
                    compressing or "tree-shaking" whatsoever to minimise its file size, and then I soon left the project unperfected (though good enough) to move onto different work.
                    <img src="prm sample.png">
                    <br>
                    This app was built with ElectronJS and also MySQL in an updated version for data storage. If you
                    want to download the whole thing to see, <a
                        href="https://github.com/Ed-Isingoma/prm/releases/tag/1.0.1">knock yourself out</a>.
                </div>
                <div class="outro">
                    I'm still learning and I'm eager to. I've explored NestJS with Prisma, Java, Flutter and a little
                    more. Im interested in venturing into mobile app development and this is likely the next app I'll
                    build. Or I'll just stay basking in the cool backend development.<br>
                    But never know-- a slight refreshing of this page might pop a new item onto that projects list üòÖÔ∏è.
                    Be expectant anytime.<br>
                    Thank you for your attention. And as you saw, the big links are at the top of the screen. Hoping to
                    hear from you.
